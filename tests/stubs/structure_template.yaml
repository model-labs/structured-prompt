Objective:
    __doc__: >
        Defines the mission of the investigation and the boundaries of success.
        Describes what must be achieved, not how to achieve it.

Global Rules:
    __doc__: >
        Declares top-level constraints and priority principles that supersede other instructions.
        Ensures the investigation remains within intended boundaries.

Operating Principles:
    __doc__: >
        Captures expected reasoning and behavior throughout the investigation,
        including tool supervision, scope discipline, and outcome orientation.

ToolReference:
    order: fixed
    __doc__: >
        Serves as a catalog of available tools with their high-level purposes and inputs,
        enabling informed tool selection during planning and execution.

Scoping:
    __doc__: >
        Records what is in and out of scope for the incident.
        Establishes the focus areas and limits for subsequent analysis.

Planning:
    __doc__: >
        Outlines the intended approach to meet the objective,
        including chosen methods and criteria for determining success or failure.

Adaptive Execution:
    __doc__: >
        Describes how and when to adjust the plan based on emerging findings,
        including whether to broaden or narrow the focus and when to revisit prior steps.
    Adaptive Execution Rule:
        __doc__: >
            States the governing rule for inserting, skipping, or repeating steps during execution.
    Tool Scope Specification:
        __doc__: >
            Defines how to select between broad exploration and deep focus given current evidence.
    Before Tool Execution:
        __doc__: >
            States the preparation expectations before invoking a tool,
            including clarity of objective, scope, and relevant prior context.
    After Tool Execution:
        __doc__: >
            States how results should be validated and how the plan should be adjusted
            in response to tool outputs.
    Tool Reengagement:
        __doc__: >
            Defines when to re-engage specific investigators or tools for targeted analysis.
    Special Cases:
        __doc__: >
            Collects predefined exception-handling patterns for unusual conditions,
            with an emphasis on explicit justification.

Reflect And Report:
    __doc__: >
        Synthesizes findings into a coherent account, consolidating evidence,
        timelines, and causal relationships across sources.
    Finalization:
        __doc__: >
            Closes the investigation record by updating name, summary, and status,
            and ensuring unrelated items are removed.

Output:
    __doc__: >
        Groups the schema and conventions for the user-facing result.
    Output Template:
        __doc__: >
            Specifies the required sections and structure of the final summary.
    Output Template Rules:
        __doc__: >
            Specifies formatting and structural conventions for the final summary.

Quality Gates:
    __doc__: >
        Represents the final quality verification concept to confirm completeness,
        coherence, and defensibility of the delivered output.
    Definition of Done:
        __doc__: >
            Conditions that must be met before the job can be considered done.
